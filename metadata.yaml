description: '"[T]he reader will perhaps find in these pages a more full and detailed
  account of the rise and fall of Rienzi, than in any English work of which I am aware."
  Cola di Rienzi (c. 1313-1354) was an Italian medieval politician and popular leader,
  tribune of the Roman people in the mid-14th century who succeeds in outwitting and
  then defeating the nobles and their followers and in raising the power of the people.
  Magnanimous at first, he is forced by events to crush the nobles'' rebellion against
  the people''s power, but popular opinion changes and even the Church, which has
  earlier urged him to assert himself, turns against him. In the end the populace
  burns the Capitol, in which Rienzi and a few adherents have made a last stand.'
